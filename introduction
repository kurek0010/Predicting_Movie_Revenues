The movie business has always been a very risky and unpredictable one. 
Our senior management is seeking to improve the quality of movie revenue forecasts by adding machine learning to its toolset. 
Improving the precision of predictions could give us a competitive advantage over other production companies. 
Senior management has asked our data & analytics team to tune, test and compare various regression models. 
We will then identify and deliver the best model with the highest prediction quality.

Your colleagues have already prepared a dataset (movies.csv) with 1) the box office revenue (target) for over 3,500 movies since 1998 and 2) various factors influencing revenues such as the movie budget (features). 
Your task as our data scientist is to tune, test and evaluate an XGBoost Regression model (with gbtree booster). 
I recommend working with Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, xgboost, and scikit-learn) for this project. 
You should use tools like pipelines, column transformers, imputers, feature scaling/standardization, and random search cross-validation for model training, tuning, evaluation, and selection. 
Before you start with the model, please perform a brief Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA). 
To evaluate the quality of predictions, use the scores Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the Coefficient of Determination (R-squared). 
Finally, your task is to identify and share the best model (and its tuned hyperparameters) that minimizes the RMSE score.
